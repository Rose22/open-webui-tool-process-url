# open-webui-tool-url-processor
URL Processor

This tool processes most types of URL's (links) you can throw at the AI, such as websites, images, videos, text files, documents, pdf's, source code and scripts, youtube videos, and more. if you give it something it doesn't support, it will tell the AI to call other tools instead. so this works very well for chaining together with other tools!

To use, just put this on an LLM that supports native function calling (native tool calling), make sure native function calling is enabled, and then just start posting links at the AI. it'll call process_url() and do what it needs to for each file type.
